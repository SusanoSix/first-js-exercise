// Evaluate what answers you would get if you ran this in the
// Javascript Console in Google Chrome. Answer the questions then 
// check them by copying them and running it in the console yourself 
// line by line 


// add variable "firstName" and "lastName" // so that they equal your name

// create a variable that holds the answer // of "firstName" + " " + "lastName"

var firstName = prompt("what is your first name?");
var lastName = prompt("what is your last name?");
var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
alert("Hellow, " + fullName);

//the above code sends two prompts requesting first and last name, then returns 
//the full name as an alert function using the fullName var


// Evaluate this question. What is a + b?
var a = 34;
var b = 21;
a = 2;
a + b // what is the answer here? the answer is 23 as a was redefined later

// What is c equal to? c is undefined
var c;
